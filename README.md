Home Run Predictor


Before running this program, you will need to install the following libraries.
You can run these commands.

pip install numpy

pip install pandas

pip install pybaseball

pip install scikit-learn

After doing that, just run the program!
If you downloaded the csv file, it should start quickly. But if not, it will take a bit of time to download the data via the pybaseball library.

After doing this, you are prompted to enter a year. You must enter a year between 2018 and 2022 (inclusive). Otherwise, it will throw an error.

Enjoy!
